# "my first Tezos smart contract"

This short tutorial shows how to install the development tools and run a minimal Tezos smart contract with LIGO. You need a Mac (tested on an Intel Mac) and some patience during the installation steps.

- Start from scratch, no previous knowledge necessary 
- Learn to develop a minimal Tezos smart contract 
- Write code in CameLIGO (https://www.ligolang.org/)
- Run the smart contract on a testnet (copy of the actual blockchain, no risk of value loss)

For a curated overview of Tezos developer resources see https://github.com/crcdng/tezos-dev-resources

## i. Install

### Install general development tools 

1. Download and install the [Visual Studio Code code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Install the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tooling environment: open a Terminal (press command-Spacebar and type "terminal"), then execute this command in the Terminal 

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

If you do not already have Apple's XCode installed, make sure that you confirm when the installations prompts you with "The XCode Command Line Tools will be installed." Alternatively, you can also get XCode from the Apple App Store.

### Install LIGO specific development tools 

3. Install the Tezos client 

In the Terminal, execute this command 

`brew tap serokell/tezos-packaging-stable https://github.com/serokell/tezos-packaging-stable.git`

then:

`brew install tezos-client`

(source: https://github.com/serokell/tezos-packaging/blob/master/docs/distros/macos.md)

4. Install LIGO 

In the Terminal, execute this command 

`brew tap ligolang/ligo https://gitlab.com/ligolang/ligo.git`

followed by

`brew install ligolang/ligo/ligo`

(source: https://www.ligolang.org/docs/intro/installation/?lang=cameligo)

5. In Visual Studio Code, install the [ligolang-vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ligolang-publish.ligo-vscode) 

...this concludes the installation. Now you are ready to code.

## ii. Code  

Download and unzip this repository (or clone it if you are familiar with git) and open the folder in Visual Studio Code. To do this, either drag and drop the folder on an open Visual Studio Code window, or on its icon in the Dock. Alternatively, select `File` -> `Open Folder...` from the menu and navigate to the folder. 

Open the file [my_first_contract.mligo](my_first_contract.mligo). This is a minimal smart contract, adapted from https://www.ligolang.org/?lang=cameligo. It looks like this: 

```ligo
type storage = int

type parameter =
  Multiply of int
| Divide of int
| Reset

type return = operation list * storage

let mul (store, delta : storage * int) : storage = store * delta
let div (store, delta : storage * int) : storage = store / delta
   
let main (action, store : parameter * storage) : return =
 ([] : operation list),   
 (match action with
   Multiply (n) -> mul (store, n)
 | Divide (n) -> div (store, n)
 | Reset         -> 0)
```

The smart contract shown here is for learning - all it does is to multiply or divide two numbers. However, its basic structure helps to understand any contract.

The first three lines define types, followed by three functions. The function called `main` takes parameters that describe the three entry points of the smart contract: one that multiplies the current value (storage) with a value, one that divides these two values and one that resets the storage to 0. 

You can learn more about LIGO and writing smart contracts in the [documentation](https://www.ligolang.org/docs/intro/introduction?lang=cameligo). For this tutorial we use that smart contract to show the next steps - compile it, deploy it to the testnet and then call the smart contract.

## iii. Compile 

### Test and compile the code 
 
Visual Studio Code has a menu that allows us to run commands: the Command Palette. With the code in `my_first_contract.mligo` open, select `View` -> `Command Palette` (or press SHIFT-CMD-P) and type `LIGO`. This provides a list of commands: 

![](images/vscode_ligo_commands.jpg)

Select `LIGO: Compile the current LIGO contract`. In the Output section of Visual Studio Code, you should see: 

```
{ parameter (or (or (int %divide) (int %multiply)) (unit %reset)) ;
  storage int ;
  code { UNPAIR ;
         IF_LEFT
           { IF_LEFT
               { SWAP ; EDIV ; IF_NONE { PUSH string "DIV by 0" ; FAILWITH } {} ; CAR }
               { SWAP ; MUL } }
           { DROP 2 ; PUSH int 0 } ;
         NIL operation ;
         PAIR } }
```

Compiling transforms code written in a higher level programming language (here: LIGO) into a lower level language (here: Michelson). In general, you write LIGO code, compile it to Michelson and send the Michelson code to run on the blockchain (you could write Michelson directly, but LIGO is easier for humans to read and write). You do not need to learn Michelson at all, but if you want to dive into the details, you can find them [here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/michelson.html).

In order to prepare the next step, you would save the Michelson code into a file with the name `my_first_contract.tz`.

## Appendix

Commands to run from the Terminal   

Compile the contract:    
`ligo compile contract my_first_contract.mligo -o my_first_contract.tz`

`ligo run interpret "mul(10,32)" --init-file my_first_contract.mligo`

Test the contract with some entry points and values:        
`ligo run dry-run my_first_contract.mligo "Multiply(32)" "10"`        
`ligo run dry-run my_first_contract.mligo "Divide(32)" "10"`        
`ligo run dry-run my_first_contract.mligo "Divide(32)" "0"`        
`ligo run dry-run my_first_contract.mligo "Reset()" "10"`        
`ligo run dry-run my_first_contract.mligo "Divide(0)" "0"`
